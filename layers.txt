N-layer architecture

database
 - a file wich store all application data

src - all source code
 - entities - object mappings
 - factories - instance generators
 - repositories - data access
 - routes - endpoint mappings
 - services - communication between the routes repositories layer (business logic)
 - util - shared code
 - handler - communication between routes and server
 - index.js - server instance

tests -> all automated tests suites
- integration tests - testing on the user point of view. It's also an E2E tests because 
there is no app consuming it.
- unit tests
    all tests that must run without any external connection such as databases, external
  APIs and, the fileSystem.
